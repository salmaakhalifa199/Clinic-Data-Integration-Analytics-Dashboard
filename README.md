Clinic Data Engineering & Analytics Pipeline

This project demonstrates an end-to-end data engineering and analytics workflow for a healthcare (clinic) dataset, covering data ingestion, transformation, storage, and visualization.

The pipeline integrates data from multiple file formats (CSV, Excel, Flat files), performs ETL processing to clean and standardize inconsistent data (especially date formats), and loads the processed data into a relational database for analysis.

An interactive Power BI dashboard is built on top of the transformed data to provide insights into patient demographics, diagnoses, doctor workloads, visit costs, and overall clinic performance. The dashboard includes KPIs, slicers, and interactive visuals to support data-driven decision making.

**Key Features**
Multi-source data ingestion (CSV, Excel, Flat files)
ETL pipeline with data cleaning, transformation, and validation
Handling inconsistent date formats and data type conversions
Centralized storage in SQL database
Interactive Power BI dashboard with KPIs and filters
Healthcare analytics and operational insights
